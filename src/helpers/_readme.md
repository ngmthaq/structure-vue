A Helper class is a lesser known code smell where a coder has identified some miscellaneous, commonly used operations and attempted to make them reusable by lumping them together in an unnatural grouping. Successive developers have then come onto the project and not realised that the helper class exists, and have consequently rewritten the same common operations, or even created more Helper classes.
